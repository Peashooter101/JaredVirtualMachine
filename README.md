### Why Jared Virtual Machine?

You see, I had a dream... That I could stop abandoning projects as soon as I started them...

While this dream is most certainly still a wild fever dream, I wanted to practice my Java by applying it to a bot.
The problem with a previous bot I tried to make (PeaScript) was that I, at least at the time, was fairly new and inexperienced to JavaScript.
Made it very hard to develop anything past a bot that enjoyed responding to messages.

By using the [Java Discord API](https://jda.wiki/), I can build a slightly more complex bot that I'd like to use on my actual Discord server without the navigation, syntax, and just general confusion that comes from being too unfamiliar with a language.

Oh also, the name "Jared Virtual Machine" is a play on Java Virtual Machine so yeah!

### Functionality

> **Warning**
> 
> This bot exists for personal use! If you take it and use it, use at your own risk.

`!ping`
- Pong!

`/vc-invite <user>`
- Used for people who have permission to join a voice channel, but their friends don't have the required permission.
- Both users must be connected to a Voice Channel and then the person with permission can invite the other to the channel.
- Uses fancy buttons for interactions and handling the invite requests.

`/abby`
- We have a [friend](https://github.com/RhythmicSys) with a cute dog.
- The command gives us easy access to Abby pictures.
- The pictures are saved and pulled from this repository!
- Supports `.mp4` videos, albeit not the way I want it.
  - Sent as a normal message, not as an embed.

`/valorant profile <valorantName>`
- Fetches some data about the Valorant account.
- valorantName should look like `Peashooter101#7016`.
- Special Thanks to [Henrik](https://docs.henrikdev.xyz/) for their Valorant API.

`Pin Message`
- This was a [Feature Request](https://github.com/Peashooter101/JaredVirtualMachine/issues/1)
- Accessed through the Context Menu (right-click Message).
- Works only for individuals with the Administrator Permission.
- Sends to the top most text channel with a "ðŸ“Œ" in its name.

---

### Planned Functionality

`/vc <invite/request> <user>`
- Change the format of the command to have two subcommands.
- `/vc request` should be the same as `/vc invite` but they are requesting permission to join.
- Make it look fancy using Embeds cause Embeds are cooler.

`/abby <search/gallery>`
- Need commands to do other additional stuff.

`/valorant <profile/rank/history/skins>`
- For the account level, draw the level onto the border rather than using their "Level Tier" for the border.
- Pull detailed ranked data for the given episode in `/valorant rank`.
  - Provide an optional argument for Episode / Act.
- Pull and generate match history data for `/valorant history`.
- Consider caching the data locally somehow... :thinking:
- Pull and display weapon skin stuff with `/valorant skins <skinName>`
  - Might need to use a database for this one chief... There are a lot of skins...
  - Consider using [Valorant-API](https://dash.valorant-api.com/) for in-game content for this command.

`/<game>`
- Similar to the `/valorant` command, pull game information depending on the game.
- Not a priority since most related practice will be done on the `/valorant` command.

`/meme <memeID> <topText> <bottomText>`
- Create a meme format!

`<Some text you sent>`
- The bot responds to messages you send sometimes, with somewhat related responses.
  - The Easy Route: Use the Sentiment Analysis or other Microsoft AI services.
  - The Hard Route: Decide to figure out what's "related" on your own.

`Pin Message`
- Add functionality to request or vote pin if you do not have permission.
- Edit so the permissions extend to people who have the ability to pin messages too (duh... but it's late at night right now).
- Figure out if there is a way to embed videos to these pinned embeds.

`/defenestrate <content>`
- Throw them out a window.

### Experimentation

I created a little playground to keep track of some experiments I am conducting in relation to this project. Think of it as a place for me to store my practice runs without having to force the bot to run. Some of the early experimentation may not be present in the Experimentation Package since I made this a few weeks after initially starting the project.

You can find the [Experimentation Package here](https://github.com/Peashooter101/JaredVirtualMachine/tree/main/src/test/java/experimentation).

> **Note**
> 
> This is meant to be a playground and will not be updated for any reason outside of me doing random tests.
> 
> It is under the `test` directory, but it is located within `experimentation` because I am not trying to test the application.
> 
> Files used as a part of experimentation are included in `JaredVM_data/Experimentation`.

Some experiments I have conducted...
- Using HttpRequest, HttpResponse, and HttpClient for GET/POST requests.
- Using Jackson API to map JSON into Objects.
- Merging, scaling, and modifying images using BufferedImage and Graphics ([OverlayImagesExp.java](https://github.com/Peashooter101/JaredVirtualMachine/blob/main/src/test/java/experimentation/OverlayImagesTest.java)).
- Converting a BufferedImage into a Base64 String and sending that info up to Imgur ([ImgurUploadTest.java](https://github.com/Peashooter101/JaredVirtualMachine/blob/main/src/test/java/experimentation/ImgurUploadTest.java)).
- Pull apart a GIF and overlay text onto it ([TextOnGifTest.java](https://github.com/Peashooter101/JaredVirtualMachine/blob/main/src/test/java/experimentation/TextOnGifTest.java)).

Some ideas I have...
- Use Graphics to draw text onto a BufferedImage ([StackOverflow Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2658554/using-graphics2d-to-overlay-text-on-a-bufferedimage-and-return-a-bufferedimage)).
  - Pull each frame out of a GIF ([StackOverflow Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8933893/convert-each-animated-gif-frame-to-a-separate-bufferedimage)).
  - Saving GIF with ImageIO ([StackOverflow Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/777947/creating-animated-gif-with-imageio)).
- Use a database that gets routinely updated by the bot because I have too much data and too much object mapping going on.
- Host a small web server to send HTML to force Discord to put videos into Embeds.
  - All Discord embeds sent by bots are `EmbedType.RICH` and Rich Embeds cannot have a video in it.
