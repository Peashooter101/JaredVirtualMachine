### Why Jared Virtual Machine?

You see, I had a dream... That I could stop abandoning projects as soon as I started them...

While this dream is most certainly still a wild fever dream, I wanted to practice my Java by applying it to a bot.
The problem with a previous bot I tried to make (PeaScript) was that I, at least at the time, was fairly new and inexperienced to JavaScript.
Made it very hard to develop anything past a bot that enjoyed responding to messages.

By using the [Java Discord API](https://jda.wiki/), I can build a slightly more complex bot that I'd like to use on my actual Discord server without the navigation, syntax, and just general confusion that comes from being too unfamiliar with a language.

Oh also, the name "Jared Virtual Machine" is a play on Java Virtual Machine so yeah!

### Functionality

> **Warning**

> Yeah no, there isn't anything that I'd consider to be stable right now. If you plan on taking my bot, uhh... Good luck...

`/vc-invite <user>`
- Used for people who have permission to join a voice channel, but their friends don't have the required permission.
- Both users must be connected to a Voice Channel and then the person with permission can invite the other to the channel.
- Uses fancy buttons for interactions and handling the invite requests.

### Planned Functionality

`/abby`
- We have a [friend](https://github.com/RhythmicSys) with a cute dog.
- The goal of this command is to give us an easy way to add new pictures of abby and pull up random ones on command use.
- Currently this is achieved by NightBot seeing a message starting with "abby" and it's tedious as heck to try to add new pictures.
